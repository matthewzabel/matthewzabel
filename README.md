- 👋 Hi, I’m @matthewzabel
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a software tester. I have been an editor for much of my career, and I see a lot of similarities between that job and the quality engineer's job.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of acronyms and terms and many basic concepts of software testing. I've been briefly introduced to Postman, math.js, python, node.js and a couple others. I've just begun learning how to use them. I'm willing to learn whatever I need to know.
- 💞️ For starters, I'm looking for some code I can practice writing tests on. I also hope to find others who are new so we can learn together.
